The task here was to install and familiarize with the YOLOv3 pytorch model

## My results
My results can be viewed in the below as the resized images. These are the most enterntaining recent images from my phone, that I wanted to see what the COCO test model and weights would do with.


*Note:* I included both resized and not resized images. The instructions specified the original size, however I had a hard time seeing the labels with that, and decided to upload both.
